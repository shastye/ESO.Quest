Developmental Setup
-------------------

In order for a developer to access the application:
* Save the repository to your device or link a new project from your IDE directly to the repository using [https://github.com/shastye/ESO.Quest.git](https://github.com/shastye/ESO.Quest.git).
* Load up your IDE, if you haven't already.
* Using an emulator, make sure the emulated device is Android 34 and is set up in a default portrait orientation.
* Using an actual device connected to your device manager, go into the app/gradle.build file and change "minSDK=33" to "minSDK=##" where ## is whatever your devices android API is.
  * This should allow the application to run on your device, and as of 7/24/2023, all features will work as they should.
* From here, you should be able to build and run the application as normal.
